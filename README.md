# Heart Disease Detection
 
Data from the "Heart Attack Prediction in the United States" data set on Kaggle

### NOTE ABOUT THE DATA: 
After having developed this model, it has come to my attention this data is synthetic and devoid of an actual signal. 
While quite unfortunate in a hilarious way, this was still not a terrible learning experience.

The current model, while lacking any predictive capability almost at all, is still a decent exercise in:\
-Pre-processing data(normalizing continuous labels and ordinal/one-hot encoding categorical features\
-hyper-parameter tuning and label selection\
-NN design in terms of neuron and label count as well as choice of activation\
-getting PyTorch to actually recognize my GPU\
